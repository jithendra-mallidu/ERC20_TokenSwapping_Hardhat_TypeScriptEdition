```shell
yarn install -> "To start with"
yarn hardhat compile -> "To compile the code and create artifacts"
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost -> "To deploy the script on the locan network of accounts spun up by hardhat"
yarn hardhat test -> "To run the test scripts that were written to test the contract and its functionalities"
yarn hardhat coverage -> "To check the test coverage of the contract"
```
